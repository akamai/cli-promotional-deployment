## Common commands

### <a name="createNew"></a>Create new pipeline
Create a pipeline for distributing properties across your environments. 

```
   Usage: akamai pipeline new-pipeline|np [options] <environments...>
   
   Create a new pipeline with provided attributes. You need a name for the pipeline, one or more environment names, and IDs for contract, group, and product. Separate each environment name with a space. Use the list commands to retrieve these IDs. This command creates one property for each environment.
   
   Options:
     -c, --contractId <contractId>               Enter the contract ID to use. If used with the -e option, the CLI takes the contract value from the template property.
     -d, --productId <productId>                 Enter the product ID to use. Optional if using -e with a property ID or name.
     -e, --propertyId <propertyId/propertyName>  Optional. Use an existing property as the blueprint for new pipeline properties. Enter a property ID or an exact property name. The CLI looks up the group ID, contract ID, and product ID of the existing property and uses that information to create properties for the pipeline.
     -g, --groupIds <groupIds>                   Enter the group IDs for the environments. Optional if using -e with a property ID or name. Provide one group ID if all environments are in the same group. If each environment needs to be in its own group, add a separate -g option for each environment and in the order the environments are listed in. (default: [])
     -n, --propver <propver>                     Add only if using a property as a template. Enter the version of the existing property to use as the blueprint. The CLI uses latest version if omitted.
     -p, --pipeline <pipelineName>               Pipeline name
     --associate-property-name                   Use an existing property with the new pipeline. When using, make sure your entry matches the property name exactly.
     --custom-property-name                      Give the existing property a custom name used only with the pipeline.
     --dry-run                                   Add only if using a property as a template. Displays the JSON generated by the current command as currently written.
     --insecure                                  Makes all new environment properties HTTP, not secure HTTPS.
     --retry                                     Use if the command failed during execution. Tries to continue where the command left off.
     --secure                                    Makes new pipeline and all environment properties use secure HTTPS.
     --variable-mode <variableMode>              If creating a pipeline from an existing property, choose how your new pipeline will pull in variables from that property.  Allowed values are ${printAllowedModes()}.

```
   Usage: akamai pipeline merge|m [options] <environment>
   
   Merge the pipeline property's template JSON and variable values into a rule tree file. The system stores the resulting JSON file in the pipeline's /dist folder.
   
   Options:
     -n, --no-validate              Merge the environment without validating.
     -p, --pipeline <pipelineName>  Pipeline name. Optional if a default pipeline
                                    was set using set-default.
